# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This Multi-Agent implements Cardiology Device Recall Optimizer for Healthcare & Life Sciences use cases.

## Components
1. **Device Intake**: Collect, validate and normalize demographics from CPOE; attach a runId and timestamp for traceability.
2. **Delegate**: Execute delegate phase for the Multi-Agent pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.
3. **Handoff**: Execute handoff phase for the Multi-Agent pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.
4. **Optimization**: Optimization across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.
5. **Plan Drafting**: Plan Drafting across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.
6. **Documentation**: Documentation across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.
7. **Outcome Measurement**: Assemble final payload with status, artifacts, KPIs and audit trail; store to Analytics Lakehouse; return response JSON for the client.

## Data Flow
- Input: Manual trigger
- Processing: 7 sequential steps
- Output: Final result
