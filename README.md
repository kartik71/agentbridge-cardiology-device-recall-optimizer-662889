## üîß Workflow Steps


### 1. Device Intake
Collect, validate and normalize demographics from CPOE; attach a runId and timestamp for traceability.

### 2. Delegate
Execute delegate phase for the Multi-Agent pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 3. Handoff
Execute handoff phase for the Multi-Agent pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 4. Optimization
Optimization across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 5. Plan Drafting
Plan Drafting across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 6. Documentation
Documentation across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 7. Outcome Measurement
Assemble final payload with status, artifacts, KPIs and audit trail; store to Analytics Lakehouse; return response JSON for the client.
